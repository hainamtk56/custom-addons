@constrains only supports simple field names, dotted names (fields of relational fields e.g. partner_id.customer) are not supported and will be ignored.

@constrains will be triggered only if the declared fields in the decorated method are included in the create or write call. It implies that fields not present in a view will not trigger a call during a record creation. A override of create is necessary to make sure a constraint will always be triggered (e.g. to test the absence of value).
